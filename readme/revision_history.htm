	<h1>ConCat/Split Revision History</h1>
	<h2>V7.0.3.0 - 10 Jan 2023</h2>
	<p>Updated to get the new email contact information and latest internal code 
	changes</p>
	<h2>V7.0.2.0 - 2 Jan 2023</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Minor fix for the update notification.</li>
		<li>Internal code changes.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>V7.0.1.0 - 14 Nov 2022</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Minor change so as not to display the completion message when the operation is cancelled.</li>
		<li>Internal code changes.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>V7 - 16 Aug 2022</h2>
	<p>
		This release is largely an overhaul of the code to bring it more up-to-date using modern C++ language and
		library features that have consequently simplified the code. Overall, there are only minimal changes for
		registered users. However, we have removed all unregistered limitations so it is now free to everyone and
		the 
		<a href="https://github.com/Dave-Lowndes/ConCat-Split" target="_blank">source code is available on GitHub</a> if you want to have a look at it.</p>
	<p>Changes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Increased the size/layout of the dialog's to better show long file names.</li>
		<li>Progress bar controls are no longer updated unnecessarily (small CPU performance improvement).</li>
		<li>Removed the "KB" indicator (was used in much older versions), which could appear incorrectly.</li>
		<li>New option "Answer Yes to All" when splitting when the split files already exist.</li>
		<li>Reinstated messages confirming completion of the operations.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>V6 - 2 Jan 2012</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Now identifies insufficient disk space before doing the bulk of the operations.<br />
			It was annoying to start an operation, have it run almost to completion,
			only to get an error due to insufficient disk space. Both the ConCat and Split
			operations now size the destination files before performing the copy operations.
			This means that if you have insufficient space on the drive, you're told about it
			much sooner.
		</li>
		<li>
			There's a new preset size: "Max FAT32". This is the maximum size of a file on
			a FAT32 drive. Even though you can get massive USB flash storage devices,
			they're often still formatted as FAT32. However, FAT32
			has a maximum file size of 4GB-1 byte, so this setting is a convenience for
			that usage. If you try to
			write a larger file size to a FAT32 drive it now quickly fails with an "out of
			space" error whereas prior versions would only fail after attempting to copy
			over 4GB of data - which could have been quite a while.
		</li>
		<li>
			There are also the common Blu-ray sizes - should anyone
			eventually need to split a file of that size!
		</li>
		<li>The Split dialog shows the path of the destination as well as the file names.</li>
		<li>The Split dialog shows the file progress information.</li>
		<li>
			Internally the split and concatenate operations can now do concurrent reading
			&amp; writing, so along with the pre-sizing change you may find some improvement in the speed of
			the operations.
		</li>
		<li>Errors when concatenating could be reported twice - they aren't now.</li>
		<li>
			There's a timing facility - hold down Shift while you click to start the
			operations and the time will be reported at the end.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>V5.0.0.3 - 1 May 2010</h2>
	<p>
		Minor update to fix slow starting of Windows Explorer when Explorer is
		invoked in some situations (such as when using WinKey+E).
	</p>
	<h2>V5.0.0.2 2 Aug 2009</h2>
	<p>Added x64 version.</p>
	<p>Changed documentation to HTML.</p>
	<p>Allow &#39;&amp;&#39; character in the registration name field.</p>
	<h2>V5.0.0.1 19 Nov 2006</h2>
	<p>
		Windows Vista compatible.<br />
		Registration is now per-user rather than per-machine so as to work under Vista
		without requiring elevation.<br />
		You will need to reenter your registration details if you upgrade from an
		earlier version.
	</p>
	<h2>V5.0.0.0 30 Sept 2005</h2>
	<p>
		Handle splitting to files &gt; 4GB. Note that only NTFS formatted disks (NT4,
		Windows 2000, Windows XP, and later operating systems) supports files greater
		than 4GB.<br />
		New fixed size options for extended CD &amp; DVD sizes.<br />
		Internal coding improvements to reduce memory usage with large selections.<br />
		Fix for minor cosmetic problem when the Split dialog is initially shown without
		the &quot;to&quot; file name(s).<br />
		Registry setting option to not display the context menu bitmap.<br />
		Use new registration number scheme.<br />
		Delete split files if the split operation is cancelled.
	</p>
	<h2>V4.1.0.1 20 Feb 2004</h2>
	<p>
		Minor change to display the regionalised About dialog from the Split dialog
		rather than the embedded English version.
	</p>
	<h2>V4.1.0.0 11 Jan 2004</h2>
	<p>
		Changes to allow language translation by having all resources in a separate
		DLL (concat.lang).<br />
		Fix for a specific situation where a system error was misreported.<br />
		Added more precise error message if the destination file couldn&#39;t be opened during the
		Split operation.
	</p>
	<h2>V4.0.0.0 21 June 2003</h2>
	<p>
		Split dialog has more preset media sizes (for memory cards and CDs) and a
		&quot;removable&quot; media option that scans all removable drives and presents the
		available space on each. Custom sizes are still catered for by entering the<br />
		figure in the combo box edit field. Very old (small) floppy preset sizes have
		been removed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Split &amp; ConCat operations are multi-threaded - the UI stays responsive and
		redraws while performing the file operations, and the operations can be
		cancelled.
	</p>
	<p>
		Supports Unicode. Windows 9x &amp; ME operating systems aren&#39;t fully Unicode, so
		support under those operating systems is limited.
	</p>
	<p>Setup now uses the MS Windows installer.</p>
	<p>
		Dialog Cancel buttons are now labeled Close except when the Split or
		Concatenate operations are working.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fixed a potential problem where the ConCat &quot;To&quot; destination file is in use
		when the ConCat operation starts. It would have resulted in being unable to
		rename the temporary destination file to the original name.
	</p>
	<p>
		Revised several error messages and improved error reporting by displaying the
		underlying Windows system error message.
	</p>
	<h2>V3.3.3.0 4 April 2002</h2>
	<p>
		Added auto-complete to the Concatenate &quot;To&quot; edit control.<br />
		Code changes ready for Unicode version.<br />
		Corrected potential problem in initialisation of split dialog.
	</p>
	<h2>V3.3.2.0 4 Oct 2001</h2>
	<p>
		Fixed a bug that caused a crash if low disk space occurred when concatenating
		files.<br />
		Modified the ConCat list display to ensure that the right hand side is normally
		visible since the numerical file extension is the most relevant part of the name
		to see. Similar for the display of the current file name that&#39;s being
		concatenated.<br />
		In a registered version, the ConCat list is now automatically sorted.<br />
		Enhanced the code used in a registered version to remove the digits to form the
		original file name.
	</p>
	<h2>V3.3.1.0 16 Sept 2001</h2>
	<p>
		Changes to the concatenate dialog to display the file part number, and to
		just show the filename (rather than the full path) in the progress section.<br />
		The concatenate file overwrite prompt now displays the file name.<br />
		Correction to support numerical output of file sizes in locales that use Indic
		grouping of numbers (e.g. 12,34,45,789).
	</p>
	<h2>V3.3.0.0 25 Nov 2000</h2>
	<p>
		Added progress displays to the dialogs to give feedback when manipulating
		large files.<br />
		Added support for files greater than 4GB. Note that only NTFS formatted disks
		(NT4, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and later operating systems) supports files
		greater than 4GB.
	</p>
	<h2>V3.2.1.1 15 Sept 2000</h2>
	<p>
		The file names in the copy batch file now have surrounding quotes to work
		with file names that have spaces in them.<br />
		Added the option to overwrite any existing files in the split operation.
	</p>
	<h2>V3.2.1.0 25 May 2000</h2>
	<p>
		Fixed a 2GB problem in the split dialog operation. Files &gt; 2GB can now be
		split and rejoined correctly.
	</p>
	<h2>V3.2.0.0 26 March 2000</h2>
	<p>
		Registered version saves the last used split size.<br />
		Display the original file size value in regional number format.<br />
		Disabled the Change button for the batch file creation in an unregistered
		version.<br />
		Removed the &quot;success&quot; dialog boxes. Confirmation is now done with a beep
		instead. Failure will still display suitable error messages.
	</p>
	<h2>V3.1.4.1 18 Sept 1999</h2>
	<p>
		Modified the About dialog. Changed the registration number field to make it a
		little easier to enter the number. Updated the home page URL and added a mail
		link.
	</p>
	<h2>V3.1.4.0 11 July 1999</h2>
	<p>
		Modified file handling (yet again). The previous method had problems
		splitting files &gt; 800 MB under Windows 9x, and even Windows NT could not cater
		for manipulating files where the total size approached 2GB. This version can now
		split and join very large files under both Windows 9x and NT.
	</p>
	<h2>V3.1.3.0 3 July 1999</h2>
	<p>Modified to handle very large files.</p>
	<h2>V3.1.2.1 30 January 1999</h2>
	<p>Minor change to allow international registration names.</p>
	<h2>V3.1.2.0 14 December 1998</h2>
	<p>
		Modified the file handling operations to allow manipulation of very large
		files (several hundred MB).
	</p>
	<h2>V3.1.1.2 December 1998</h2>
	<p>Rebuilt, and updated documentation for the new self extracting installer.</p>
	<h2>V3.1.1 June 1998</h2>
	<p>Added cosmetic bitmaps for the menu items to aid visibility.</p>
	<h2>V3.1 October 1997</h2>
	<p>New registration system.</p>
	<p>
		Improved presentation of long items in the ConCat dialog list box - uses the
		familiar ellipses notation for long paths.
	</p>

<h3>ConCat/Split Revision History</h3>
<h4>V6 - 2 Jan 2012</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Now identifies insufficient disk space before doing the bulk of the operations.<br />
It was annoying to start an operation, have it run almost to completion, 
only to get an error due to insufficient disk space. Both the ConCat and Split 
	operations now size the destination files before performing the copy operations. 
	This means that if you have insufficient space on the drive, you're told about it 
	much sooner.</li>
	<li>There's a new preset size: "Max FAT32". This is the maximum size of a file on 
a FAT32 drive. Even though you can get massive USB flash storage devices, 
they're often still formatted as FAT32. However, FAT32 
has a maximum file size of 4GB-1 byte, so this setting is a convenience for 
that usage. If you try to 
write a larger file size to a FAT32 drive it now quickly fails with an "out of 
space" error whereas prior versions would only fail after attempting to copy 
over 4GB of data - which could have been quite a while.</li>
	<li>There are also the common Blu-ray sizes - should anyone 
eventually need to split a file of that size!</li>
	<li>The Split dialog shows the path of the destination as well as the file names.</li>
	<li>The Split dialog shows the file progress information.</li>
	<li>Internally the split and concatenate operations can now do concurrent reading 
	&amp; writing, so along with the pre-sizing change you may find some improvement in the speed of 
	the operations.</li>
	<li>Errors when concatenating could be reported twice - they aren't now.</li>
	<li>There's a timing facility - hold down Shift while you click to start the 
	operations and the time will be reported at the end.</li>
</ul>
<h4>V5.0.0.3 - 1 May 2010</h4>
<p>Minor update to fix slow starting of Windows Explorer when Explorer is 
invoked in some situations (such as when using WinKey+E).</p>
<h4>V5.0.0.2 2 Aug 2009</h4>
<p>Added x64 version.</p>
<p>Changed documentation to HTML.</p>
<p>Allow &#39;&amp;&#39; character in the registration name field.</p>
<h4>V5.0.0.1 19 Nov 2006</h4>
<p>Windows Vista compatible.<br />
Registration is now per-user rather than per-machine so as to work under Vista 
without requiring elevation.<br />
You will need to reenter your registration details if you upgrade from an 
earlier version.</p>
<h4>V5.0.0.0 30 Sept 2005</h4>
<p>Handle splitting to files &gt; 4GB. Note that only NTFS formatted disks (NT4, 
Windows 2000, Windows XP, and later operating systems) supports files greater 
than 4GB.<br />
New fixed size options for extended CD &amp; DVD sizes.<br />
Internal coding improvements to reduce memory usage with large selections.<br />
Fix for minor cosmetic problem when the Split dialog is initially shown without 
the &quot;to&quot; file name(s).<br />
Registry setting option to not display the context menu bitmap.<br />
Use new registration number scheme.<br />
Delete split files if the split operation is cancelled.</p>
<h4>V4.1.0.1 20 Feb 2004</h4>
<p>Minor change to display the regionalised About dialog from the Split dialog 
rather than the embedded English version.</p>
<h4>V4.1.0.0 11 Jan 2004</h4>
<p>Changes to allow language translation by having all resources in a separate 
DLL (concat.lang).<br />
Fix for a specific situation where a system error was misreported.<br />
Added more precise error message if the destination file couldn&#39;t be opened during the 
Split operation.</p>
<h4>V4.0.0.0 21 June 2003</h4>
<p>Split dialog has more preset media sizes (for memory cards and CDs) and a 
&quot;removable&quot; media option that scans all removable drives and presents the 
available space on each. Custom sizes are still catered for by entering the<br />
figure in the combo box edit field. Very old (small) floppy preset sizes have 
been removed.</p>
<p>Split &amp; ConCat operations are multi-threaded - the UI stays responsive and 
redraws while performing the file operations, and the operations can be 
cancelled.</p>
<p>Supports Unicode. Windows 9x &amp; ME operating systems aren&#39;t fully Unicode, so 
support under those operating systems is limited.</p>
<p>Setup now uses the MS Windows installer.</p>
<p>Dialog Cancel buttons are now labeled Close except when the Split or 
Concatenate operations are working.</p>
<p>Fixed a potential problem where the ConCat &quot;To&quot; destination file is in use 
when the ConCat operation starts. It would have resulted in being unable to 
rename the temporary destination file to the original name.</p>
<p>Revised several error messages and improved error reporting by displaying the 
underlying Windows system error message.</p>
<h4>V3.3.3.0 4 April 2002</h4>
<p>Added auto-complete to the Concatenate &quot;To&quot; edit control.<br />
Code changes ready for Unicode version.<br />
Corrected potential problem in initialisation of split dialog.</p>
<h4>V3.3.2.0 4 Oct 2001</h4>
<p>Fixed a bug that caused a crash if low disk space occurred when concatenating 
files.<br />
Modified the ConCat list display to ensure that the right hand side is normally 
visible since the numerical file extension is the most relevant part of the name 
to see. Similar for the display of the current file name that&#39;s being 
concatenated.<br />
In a registered version, the ConCat list is now automatically sorted.<br />
Enhanced the code used in a registered version to remove the digits to form the 
original file name.</p>
<h4>V3.3.1.0 16 Sept 2001</h4>
<p>Changes to the concatenate dialog to display the file part number, and to 
just show the filename (rather than the full path) in the progress section.<br />
The concatenate file overwrite prompt now displays the file name.<br />
Correction to support numerical output of file sizes in locales that use Indic 
grouping of numbers (e.g. 12,34,45,789).</p>
<h4>V3.3.0.0 25 Nov 2000</h4>
<p>Added progress displays to the dialogs to give feedback when manipulating 
large files.<br />
Added support for files greater than 4GB. Note that only NTFS formatted disks 
(NT4, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and later operating systems) supports files 
greater than 4GB.</p>
<h4>V3.2.1.1 15 Sept 2000</h4>
<p>The file names in the copy batch file now have surrounding quotes to work 
with file names that have spaces in them.<br />
Added the option to overwrite any existing files in the split operation.</p>
<h4>V3.2.1.0 25 May 2000</h4>
<p>Fixed a 2GB problem in the split dialog operation. Files &gt; 2GB can now be 
split and rejoined correctly.</p>
<h4>V3.2.0.0 26 March 2000</h4>
<p>Registered version saves the last used split size.<br />
Display the original file size value in regional number format.<br />
Disabled the Change button for the batch file creation in an unregistered 
version.<br />
Removed the &quot;success&quot; dialog boxes. Confirmation is now done with a beep 
instead. Failure will still display suitable error messages.</p>
<h4>V3.1.4.1 18 Sept 1999</h4>
<p>Modified the About dialog. Changed the registration number field to make it a 
little easier to enter the number. Updated the home page URL and added a mail 
link.</p>
<h4>V3.1.4.0 11 July 1999</h4>
<p>Modified file handling (yet again). The previous method had problems 
splitting files &gt; 800 MB under Windows 9x, and even Windows NT could not cater 
for manipulating files where the total size approached 2GB. This version can now 
split and join very large files under both Windows 9x and NT.</p>
<h4>V3.1.3.0 3 July 1999</h4>
<p>Modified to handle very large files.</p>
<h4>V3.1.2.1 30 January 1999</h4>
<p>Minor change to allow international registration names.</p>
<h4>V3.1.2.0 14 December 1998</h4>
<p>Modified the file handling operations to allow manipulation of very large 
files (several hundred MB).</p>
<h4>V3.1.1.2 December 1998</h4>
<p>Rebuilt, and updated documentation for the new self extracting installer.</p>
<h4>V3.1.1 June 1998</h4>
<p>Added cosmetic bitmaps for the menu items to aid visibility.</p>
<h4>V3.1 October 1997</h4>
<p>New registration system.</p>
<p>Improved presentation of long items in the ConCat dialog list box - uses the 
familiar ellipses notation for long paths.</p>

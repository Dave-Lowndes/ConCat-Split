<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>ConCat/Split is a Windows Explorer context menu extension that provides two 
complementary facilities:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A split facility that lets you easily convert a single large file 
	into several smaller ones. You can copy these smaller files onto multiple removable 
	media devices or email them as attachments where you may be prevented from 
	doing so with the original file size.</li>
	<li>A file concatenation facility that performs the same operation as the 
	command line &quot;copy /b SrcFile1+SrcFile2 [+SrcFileN] DestnFile&quot; operation. 
	With ConCat, you can append any number of files and store the result as a 
	new file, or overwrite an existing file.</li>
</ol>
<p>ConCat runs under Windows 7 SP2 and later versions of Windows, and is available for x86 (32-bit) and x64 
(64-bit) systems.</p>

<h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>
<p>We recommend that you unzip the ConCat.zip file and run the Setup.exe from 
your hard disk. </p>
<p>You need to run the installation from an account with access to Administrator 
privileges.</p>
<p>The last step of Setup informs you that ConCat is installed and briefly 
tells you how to use it. <strong>If you&#39;re upgrading an existing version, we 
recommend that you log off and back on again, or restart your computer to ensure 
Explorer has unloaded the prior version.</strong></p>
<p>If your system administrator has applied the EnforceShellExtensionSecurity policy to limit 
the use of shell extensions to approved ones, they will need to add ConCat to 
that list in the registry: </p>
<p>Create a REG_SZ value whose name is &quot;{B2D4ADE0-0C85-11cf-872F-444553540000}&quot; 
under the HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell 
Extensions\Approved branch.</p>
<h3>Administration Installation</h3>
<p>The installer supports the MSI administrative installation options. For example:</p>
<p class="IndentedInstruction">msiexec /jm concat.msi</p>
<p>&quot;Advertises&quot; ConCat on all the machine&#39;s users Programs menu items. When a 
user invokes the Start, Programs, JD Design, ConCat, ConCat-Split Documentation option, the 
installation of ConCat will complete.</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p class="IndentedInstruction">msiexec /a concat.msi</p>
<p>Performs an &quot;administrative&quot; installation to a shared network location.</p>
<h3>Files Installed</h3>
<p>ConCat setup installs files to the following directories: </p>
<table style="width: 100%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="8">
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><span style="white-space:nowrap">%ProgramFiles%\JD&nbsp;Design\</span>ConCat</td>
		<td valign="top">The main installation directory.<br />
		Contains the core program files, including the ConCat shell extension DLL.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">...\doc</td>
		<td valign="top">The documentation directory, contains this document and related 
		image files.</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
<p>Setup will also add relevant registry entries and Start menu items.</p>
<h2><a name="HowToUse"></a>How do you use ConCat?</h2>
<h3><a name="SplitUse"></a>Split a single large file into multiple smaller ones</h3>
<p>Use Windows Explorer and select the file that you want to split. Display the 
context menu by right-clicking (the secondary mouse button). Choose the &quot;Split File...&quot; menu item to display the Split 
dialog box:</p>
<p><img alt="Split Context Menu" height="131" src="splitmenu.png" width="440" /></p>
<p><img alt="Split Dialog" height="385" src="splitdialog.png" width="508" /></p>
<p>Operation of this dialog box is straightforward. The &quot;Split Size&quot; group radio 
buttons populate the combo box list with either:</p>
<ol class="style2">
	<li>Common drive sizes, or</li>
	<li>The free space size of any removable drives on your system that 
	have media inserted in them. When you select this option, it may take a few 
	seconds to find what&#39;s available. If there are no removable drives with 
	media inserted, the combo list will be empty.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can enter a custom size setting by typing a value (in bytes) in the edit 
field of the combo box.</p>
<p>The destination names field shows the range of file names that the split operation 
will produce. The default location for the split files is the same 
location as the original file, however you can change the location and name of the destination 
files if you use the Change button.</p>
<p>You can opt to create a batch file that will rejoin the 
	files easily on any MS-DOS compatible system that does not have Split/ConCat 
	installed.</p>
<p>To perform the split operation, press the &quot;Split File&quot; button.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The split operation is non-destructive; it will not delete your 
original file.</li>
	<li>The last split size is saved between uses.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="ConcatUse"></a>Concatenate split files to create a copy of the 
original</h3>
<p>For ease of use we recommend that you copy the individual files that you have previously split into a folder on 
your hard disk.</p>
<p>Using Windows Explorer, select the files that you want to join. Display 
the context menu by right-clicking (the secondary mouse button) in the selection. Choose the &quot;Concatenate Files...&quot; menu item to 
display the Concatenate dialog box.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Concatenate Context Menu" height="191" src="concatmenu.png" width="434" /></p>
<p>
<img alt="Concatenate Dialog" height="359" src="concatdialog.png" width="508" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important: The selected order of the files in the Explorer window determines 
the order that the files are copied. The first file is always the one with the 
focus (the fine dotted rectangle around it). Here is how you can ensure that you get the files 
copied in the correct order. Note: this is unnecessary if you've split the files and 
retained the numeric naming convention - as the selected files are automatically 
sorted in the Concat dialog's list.</p>
<ol class="style3">
	<li>Select the first file.</li>
	<li>Hold down the shift key and click the last file that you want.</li>
	<li>Release the shift key and right-click on the first selected item 
	to bring up the context menu.</li>
	<li>Choose the &quot;Concatenate Files...&quot; item to display the Concatenate Files 
	dialog box.</li>
	<li>The order that the files appear in the &quot;Join&quot; list box, is the 
	order that they will be concatenated. Ensure that this is the order that you 
	want.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the file order isn't correct in the Join list, you can re-order them by 
selecting the file in the Join list box and use the up and down buttons as 
required. The buttons respond to the keyboard accelerators Alt+U 
	&amp; Alt+D.</p>
<h4><a name="ContextMenuBitmap"></a>Context Menu Bitmap Display</h4>
<p>If you&#39;d prefer not to have the bitmap displayed on the Explorer context
menu, add the following registry setting:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JD Design\ConCat</p>
<p>Create a DWORD value named &quot;Options&quot; and set the value to 0 to disable
the bitmap.</p>
<h3><a name="BatchFileLimitation"></a>Batch file limitation</h3>
<p>Although Concat/Split can handle Unicode file names, the ability to handle 
them is currently limited in Windows and only work from either 
an existing command prompt that is set to have UTF-8 as its code page (using chcp 65001), or via Windows File Explorer when Windows has the setting "Use 
Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support" 
enabled.</p>
<p>Consequently, the split batch file is not a Unicode file, which means that any file 
name characters that are not in the current code page are replaced with '?'. 
This happens to have the effect that when the command runs, because the '?' is a 
single character wildcard, it may well match the intended file. We don't recommend relying on this, so avoid the situation and ensure any files that you 
split (and where you intend to use the batch file to re-join) only use 
characters that are valid in your region.</p>

<h1>ConCat/Split V6</h1>
<p>ConCat/Split is a Windows Explorer context menu extension that provides two 
complementary facilities:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A split facility that lets you easily convert a single large file 
	into several smaller ones. You can copy these smaller files onto removable 
	media such as a memory card, floppy disks, or CDs, or send them through 
	email systems that will not allow large attachments.</li>
	<li>A file concatenation facility that performs the same operation as the 
	command line &quot;copy /b SrcFile1+SrcFile2 [+SrcFileN] DestnFile&quot; operation. 
	With ConCat, you can append any number of files and store the result as a 
	new file, or overwrite one of the original files.</li>
</ol>
<p>ConCat runs under Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 (and the server 
variants of those operating systems), and is available for x86 (32-bit) and x64 
(64-bit) systems.</p>
<h4>ConCat - Copyright <span class="style1">©</span> 1996-2012 JD Design, All Rights Reserved</h4>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>We recommend that you unzip the ConCat.zip file and run the Setup.exe from 
your hard disk. </p>
<p>You need to run the installation from an account with access to Administrator 
privileges.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have an up-to-date copy of the Windows Installer, the setup 
program may download it. </p>
<p>The last step of Setup informs you that ConCat is installed and briefly 
tells you how to use it. <strong>If you&#39;re upgrading an existing version, we 
recommend that you log off and back on again, or restart your computer to ensure 
Explorer has unloaded the prior version.</strong> </p>
<p>If your system administrator has applied the EnforceShellExtensionSecurity policy to limit 
the use of shell extensions to approved ones, they will need to add ConCat to 
that list in the registry: </p>
<p>Create a REG_SZ value whose name is &quot;{B2D4ADE0-0C85-11cf-872F-444553540000}&quot; 
under the HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell 
Extensions\Approved branch.</p>
<h3>Administration Installation</h3>
<p>The installer supports the MSI administrative installation options. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p class="IndentedInstruction">msiexec /jm concat.msi</p>
<p>&quot;Advertises&quot; ConCat on all the machine&#39;s users Programs menu items. When a 
user invokes the Start, Programs, JD Design, ConCat, ConCat-Split Documentation option, the 
installation of ConCat will complete.</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p class="IndentedInstruction">msiexec /a concat.msi</p>
<p>Performs an &quot;administrative&quot; installation to a shared network location.</p>
<h3>Files Installed</h3>
<p>ConCat setup installs files to the following directories: </p>
<table style="width: 100%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="8">
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><span style="white-space:nowrap">%ProgramFiles%\JD&nbsp;Design\</span>ConCat</td>
		<td valign="top">The main installation directory.<br />
		Contains the core program files, including the ConCat shell extension DLL.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">...\doc</td>
		<td valign="top">The documentation directory, contains this document and related 
		image files.</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
<p>Setup will also add relevant registry entries and Start menu items.</p>
<h2>How Do You Use ConCat?</h2>
<h3>Split</h3>
<p>Use Windows Explorer and select the file that you want to split. Display the 
context menu by right-clicking (the secondary mouse button), or use the Explorer 
window&#39;s File menu. Choose the &quot;Split File...&quot; menu item to display the Split 
dialog box:</p>
<p><img alt="Split Context Menu" height="212" src="splitmenu.png" width="645" /></p>
<p><img alt="Split Dialog" height="391" src="splitdialog.png" width="348" /></p>
<p>Operation of this dialog box is straightforward. The &quot;Split Size&quot; group radio 
buttons populate the combo box list with either:</p>
<ol class="style2">
	<li>Common drive sizes, or</li>
	<li>The free space size of any removable drives on your system that 
	have media inserted in them. When you select this option, it may take a few 
	seconds to find what&#39;s available. If there are no removable drives with 
	media inserted , the combo list will be empty.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can enter a custom size setting by typing a value (in KB) in the edit 
field of the combo box.<br />
<br />
The destination names field shows the range of file names that you will get from 
the split operation. The default location for the split files is the same 
location as the original file, however you can change the location and name of the destination 
files if you use the Change button.</p>
<p>To perform the split operation, press the &quot;Split File&quot; button.</p>
<p>Note: the split operation is non-destructive; it will not delete your 
original file.</p>
<h3>Concatenate</h3>
<p>For ease of use we recommend that you copy the individual files that you have previously split into a folder on 
your hard disk.</p>
<p>Using Windows Explorer, select the files that you want to concatenate. Display 
the context menu by right-clicking (the secondary mouse button), or use the 
Explorer window&#39;s File menu. Choose the &quot;Concatenate Files...&quot; menu item to 
display the Concatenate dialog box.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Concatenate Context Menu" height="262" src="concatmenu.png" width="653" /></p>
<p>
<img alt="Concatenate Dialog" height="306" src="concatdialog.png" width="343" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important: The selected order of the files in the Explorer window determines 
the order that the files are copied. The first file is always the one with the 
focus (the fine dotted rectangle around it). Here is how you can ensure that you get the files 
copied in the correct order:</p>
<ol class="style3">
	<li>Select the first file.</li>
	<li>Hold down the shift key and click the last file that you want.</li>
	<li>Release the shift key and right-click on the first selected item 
	to bring up the context menu.</li>
	<li>Choose the &quot;Concatenate Files...&quot; item to display the Concatenate Files 
	dialog box.</li>
	<li>The order that the files appear in the &quot;Copy&quot; list box, is the 
	order that they will be concatenated. Ensure that this is the order that you 
	want.</li>
</ol>
<p>In an unregistered version, the default destination file name is the same as 
the first selected file. If you want to alter this, change the &quot;To&quot; file name 
before you press the OK button.</p>
<h4>Context Menu Bitmap Display</h4>
<p>If you&#39;d prefer not to have the bitmap displayed on the Explorer context
menu, add the following registry setting:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JD Design\ConCat</p>
<p>Create a DWORD value named &quot;Options&quot; and set the value to 0 to disable
the bitmap.</p>
<h2>Registered Version Features</h2>
<p>The registered version of ConCat adds the following features: </p>
<ul>
	<li>The ConCat dialog box has the ability to re-order the files you want to 
	join, making it unimportant to select the files in the correct order in the 
	first place. Select the file in the Copy list box and use the up and down 
	buttons as required. The buttons respond to the keyboard accelerators Alt+U 
	&amp; Alt+D.</li>
	<li>Automatically selects the correct destination filename for files that 
	are split and retain their Split/ConCat naming convention.</li>
	<li>The ability to automatically create a batch file that will rejoin the 
	files easily on any MS-DOS compatible system that does not have Split/ConCat 
	installed.</li>
	<li>The last split size is saved between uses.</li>
</ul>
